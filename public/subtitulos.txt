00:00:00.080 Today we're going to talk about the single tactic that will help you build a massive cult following for your brand.
00:00:05.200 This method ties directly into our primal human needs. It's baked into our DNA and if you use it correctly, it can
00:00:11.679 create a community of millions of people all around the world. And the interesting thing about this process is it's one of the least talked about
00:00:18.080 topics when it comes to branding and one of the most powerful in terms of actually connecting people to your
00:00:23.760 brand. If you want to build an audience of millions of fans, which will in turn create your dreams of freedom and
00:00:24.000 No text
00:00:28.800 wealth, you're going to need to understand today's topic, which is how to create a brand belief system and how
00:00:34.239 that ties into your brand. Every great brand, well-known music artist, religion, or cult, pun intended, is
00:00:42.079 built on a foundation of rich and emotional brand beliefs. Strong, defined belief systems allow human beings to
00:00:48.559 join communities that center around those beliefs. If you give someone guidelines on a belief system and
00:00:54.160 present it in a compelling way, they can easily decide if it's something that they want to belong to and adopt into
00:01:00.160 their own identity. By using a well-defined belief system, you can convert someone from I like this to I am
00:01:07.040 this. And when you do that, you psychologically connect them to your brand and its offerings for life. They
00:01:12.640 aren't just saying I like this. They're saying that I identify with this community and it's a reflection of me.
00:01:18.799 Whether you're a music brand, fashion brand, or product company, understanding today's topic will put the most powerful
00:01:24.560 tool brand has to offer in your toolkit and it will allow you to compete with the best in the world with whatever it
00:01:30.799 is you're trying to build. So, who am I to even talk about this topic? My name is Chris Alba and for the last 15 years,
00:01:35.920 I've been a brand strategist and creative director for some of the world's largest companies as well as household name music artists. I started
00:01:42.079 my creative agency, The Cole Creatives, 11 years ago. We've done tens of millions of dollars in business and have
00:01:47.200 been blessed to create and execute thousands of campaigns and stories often for international audiences. I've seen
00:01:52.799 firsthand many times over that initial spark of a brand or story that starts
00:01:58.000 connecting with an audience and how that spark becomes the fire that provides brands all kinds of financial success as
00:02:05.040 well as bringing the brand to the forefront of the conversation in that culture. And if there's one thing that I
00:02:10.080 saw over and over again over the last 15 years was if a brand was using its belief system as a core element and then
00:02:16.879 it had stealth storytelling, how that belief system converted people into involving themselves in the brand in all
00:02:24.319 sorts of different ways. And that involvement could be things like buying products, buying tickets, sharing
00:02:29.680 stories or content with friends, or showing up to the brand's pop-ups, shows, or community events. Without
00:02:35.680 having clarity around your belief system and what your brand actually stands for, it'll be hard to build a true community
00:02:41.760 of super fans. Even if you have a hit in whatever industry you're in, without brand beliefs and story, the eyes and
00:02:48.319 ears that you earn from that hit will slowly start to float away. In today's video, I'm going to give you the exact
00:02:54.160 step-by-step process on how to develop your own brand beliefs that you and your audience can participate in to show the
00:03:00.720 faith you have in your brand. But before we deep dive into the process, let's first look at how these brand beliefs
00:03:06.400 can draw people in and why do human beings crave belonging in the first place. Section one, a humans need to
00:03:11.000 No text
00:03:13.120 belong. Okay, so imagine being born thousands of years ago, not in a city or
00:03:18.239 a house, but in the wild. Back then, survival meant sticking together. Being part of a group wasn't just nice, it was
00:03:24.959 literally life or death. If you got kicked out of a group or left behind, chances are you wouldn't make it alone.
00:03:30.959 That's why one of the primary fears that human beings have is dying alone. There's hard science that proves that
00:03:37.040 our need to belong is hardwired into us. The people who stayed close to the group who built strong bonds, those were the
00:03:44.080 ones that survived long enough to pass on their genes to the next generation. So, generation after generation, this
00:03:50.560 instinct to connect and belong only got stronger. And although many of us today aren't living in a world of small
00:03:55.920 tribes, this instinct is just as powerful. Our brains still treat belonging like a survival issue. That's
00:04:02.480 why rejection feels as intense as it does and why acceptance, whether it's a friend inviting you to hang out or a
00:04:09.280 stranger smiling at you, feels as good as it does. Your brain reads those little moments as safety signals.
00:04:15.760 Subconsciously, your brain thinks, "We will survive." So, when you think about building an audience, whether you're a
00:04:21.120 music artist or creative business, you're essentially a community builder. And it's important to know the game that
00:04:27.280 you're in is more biological and psychological than it may be creative. Joining communities is part of our
00:04:34.080 builtin survival DNA. There's an actual scientific concept called the need to belong theory and it was created by Roy
00:04:41.040 Bowmeister and Mark Liry in the 1990s. They argued that the drive to form strong lasting relationships is just as
00:04:48.639 fundamental as hunger or thirst. This theory also explains why humans build so many different types of groups. From
00:04:55.520 family groups to friend circles, clubs, online communities, fan groups of all kinds, music, sports, games, movies,
00:05:02.479 shows, every one of these groups is a way to meet deep psychological needs. Belonging is the invisible thread that
00:05:10.160 ties all human culture together. So belonging isn't just a want, it's a need to survive. But in this, there's also
00:05:16.720 strong science behind the consequences of feelings of not belonging. A lack of belonging can cause higher risk of
00:05:23.280 depression, anxiety, and shorter lifespans. Have you ever heard the story of a widowerower or widow whose spouse
00:05:29.360 passed away and then within a few months they also join them. And then what about retirement? How quickly someone's health
00:05:35.520 can decline and they pass away soon after retiring. Before retirement, they felt a feeling of being a part of
00:05:41.120 something. They had purpose, a cause, and a belonging. and then all of a sudden they didn't. Their mind
00:05:47.120 acknowledged the shift and then their body's physiological makeup changed just
00:05:52.160 by a sense of a lack of belonging. So, human beings need to belong. We're wired for it. But what do we do when we found
00:05:59.039 something to belong to? How far will humans go to feel that sense of belonging? And how can you use this
00:06:05.039 knowledge to build your own community? Section two, the transformation into a belief system. The best branded
00:06:06.000 No text
00:06:11.280 communities have clear belief systems. But how is it that they get you in and keep you in? What's the psychology here?
00:06:17.759 So, to start, there needs to be a point of entry. So, let's run the scenario. You've heard about a new community and
00:06:23.600 they've clearly presented you their beliefs and what they're all about. Based on your life experiences, you
00:06:28.639 identify with those beliefs and you want in. But how do you get in? To become a part of a community, there has to be a
00:06:34.479 point of conversion. A significant transformation will occur that brings you in. Gangs have initiations.
00:06:40.479 Fraternities and sororities have pledge week. The Army has boot camp. Exclusive country clubs have applications, but
00:06:47.280 within the application, they also have sponsorships. An existing member of the club needs to recommend you to even be
00:06:53.680 considered for entry. Another example could be buying your first product from a known clothing company or buying your
00:06:58.960 first ticket or piece of merch from a music artist. Each of these are examples of how to signal your commitment into
00:07:05.440 the new community. There's a clear boundary that's set. This is who's in and this is who's not. There are pros
00:07:11.199 and cons to being on either side, which is set by the brand's beliefs. Once a transformation occurs, you then take on
00:07:17.440 the community with your own identity. Boot camp turns civilians into soldiers.
00:07:22.479 Rushw week turns complete strangers into fraternity brothers and sorority sisters. The shared initiation and
00:07:29.520 joining of the group gives members a story of belonging that they can carry with them forever. So now understanding
00:07:35.520 the why and the power behind these belief systems, how are these systems actually made? What's the creative
00:07:41.520 process for going about and creating a belief system for your own brand? So for those interested, we do have a workbook
00:07:47.840 available to help walk you through the process of crafting your own brand beliefs. If you want that workbook,
00:07:52.880 comment cult brand beliefs. As always, there's no signups, no emails, no newsletters. It's just something I want
00:07:58.560 you to have if you need it. Section three, how to find your brand's beliefs. Okay, so now we've established how
00:07:59.000 No text
00:08:04.160 important these brand beliefs are for your brand, but let's get into the step-by-step process of creating your
00:08:09.280 brand beliefs and its foundation. Step one, define the enemy. A huge part of recruiting for a group or community is
00:08:16.319 clearly defining the difference between being inside and being outside. Who opposes the group? Who is the enemy or
00:08:23.360 who is the villain? Who's in opposition? An insider inside the group might think
00:08:28.720 they don't believe what we believe. For example, this could be for people in a group who've decided to go and live
00:08:34.320 off-rid. They oppose the people choosing the rat race world of the double espresso, the commute, the mundane
00:08:40.958 9to-5, and the sleeping pill. In the fashion world, this could be fashion enthusiasts against those who don't care
00:08:46.720 about their style or the details in the clothes they wear. Then for religions, this can be believers and non-believers.
00:08:53.200 This also works for tech people. Think about Apple's campaign for I'm a Mac and I'm a PC. clear opposing group of PC
00:09:00.000 owners versus Mac owners. This also can be applied to workout groups like CrossFit or Pilates, vegans versus
00:09:06.959 carnivore, quality versus mediocre, gamers versus non-gamers. For military
00:09:12.320 factions, there's all kinds of groups in opposition to them that they must defend against. Even Taylor Swift has her
00:09:18.640 swifty army of devoted followers ready to defend her at any turn. Being a Taylor Swift fan isn't just that you
00:09:25.120 enjoy the music. She's built an entire culture around her community of what it means to be a fan and how you must
00:09:31.920 defend the things that you love and show up with truth and honesty. The number of shows that you've been to is like
00:09:38.000 earning stripes in the army, deepening your connection with the group. So, to recap, to start the process of creating
00:09:44.720 your brand belief system, first define who the enemy is or who's in opposition
00:09:49.760 to the group. Step two, define the archetype. A big part of presenting a brand is defining what kind of brand it
00:09:56.399 will be. A large part of this will be influenced by the brand's personality archetype. I have a previous video on
00:10:01.440 the neighborhood art supply channel where I go more in depth to brand personality archetypes. If you haven't seen that yet, it can be good to check
00:10:07.440 so you have an understanding of this part for the brand building process. So for example, if you are a rebel or
00:10:13.120 outlaw brand and you are primarily motivated by chasing freedom, this would influence your brand belief system and
00:10:19.760 even how the brand beliefs themselves would be worded through that belief system. You'd be trying to attract others who identify as rebels or people
00:10:27.279 that aspire to be more free. And then the same thing if you are a hero brand that stood for doing good things in the
00:10:32.480 world and achieving those good things through hard work and sacrifice. This would attract other heroes into your
00:10:38.880 brand. So, your brand beliefs draft off of the overall personality and position of the brand itself. And before you
00:10:45.279 start writing out your brand beliefs, it'll be important to define your archetype or your archetype blend. And
00:10:50.480 remember, you can mix archetypes, but it's my recommendation that there's no more than two. And if there is two,
00:10:56.240 that's an 8020 split between those two. 80% being one of the archetypes is more
00:11:02.000 dominant and then the other archetype is a spice that's part of the brand. And as a note here, some brands will have three
00:11:08.399 and they'll go 70 3010 for those three. But in my opinion, that's a bit more
00:11:14.160 advanced. So if you're new to this, I'd say try to have one or two. And if it is
00:11:19.360 two, keep it at the 8020. Step three, mine for deep personal beliefs. So as we
00:11:25.120 get into crafting our brand's belief system, let's first look at some overarching core beliefs of things that
00:11:30.800 you personally believe and you want to be sure that those things are a part of this brand. So, a good exercise for this
00:11:36.480 can be asking yourself this question. What if you had five billboards in five different locations all around the
00:11:42.720 world? You worked out an agreement where no matter what, these billboards would stay up for the next 500 years. Each of
00:11:49.519 these billboards could only have one single phrase on them. And these phrases would be phrases of encouragement that
00:11:55.360 you'd be leaving for generations to come. These billboards would give the people who see them a glimpse into your
00:12:00.720 point of view and how you see the world. So for example, some of these billboards could be things like this. Example one,
00:12:07.360 make things and share things. Example two, freedom is all there is. Chase it
00:12:12.959 with every breath. Example three, life is hard. Might as well laugh your way
00:12:18.079 through. Example four, do the right thing no matter the cost. Example five,
00:12:23.360 there's so much we haven't explored. Go further. Example six, believe in the unseen power of the universe. Example
00:12:30.160 seven, if everyone starts wearing white clothes, maybe it's time to put on something black. So, this exercise
00:12:36.639 because of the setup of how you're thinking about it can lead to some of your own personal core beliefs, things
00:12:42.320 that are super important to you and how you see the world. And sometimes what can happen is once you see some of the
00:12:47.600 ideas written out on paper, they can seem contradictory from one another. And that's okay. Don't worry about that. You
00:12:53.760 have many sides to your personality and you believe in a lot of different things. But it's good in this exercise to find some highlevel core beliefs of
00:13:00.880 what you're trying to put out in the world. These personal beliefs that you hold since you're the brand's builder can be foundational in creating the
00:13:07.600 brand's belief system. And remember, this brand is a part of you, but it's not all of you. You're directing and
00:13:13.279 presenting a movie, your brand, for an audience to experience. You want that movie to authentically tie into you in
00:13:19.839 some way, but every side of you doesn't need to be in this movie. Keep in mind that the same guy who directed Mad Max
00:13:26.079 Fury Road also did Happy Feet. Same guy showing two different sides of himself within two different brands. And that's
00:13:32.639 where a lot of artists can struggle is they try to put too many things into their brand and they think it should
00:13:37.839 showcase every side of them. So now that you have some of your highlevel potential brand beliefs, let's go
00:13:43.519 further into the weeds. Step four, ideulate on beliefs. So in this exercise, you're now going to start
00:13:48.639 coming up with belief concepts. You're going to write out as many as you can possibly think of. For this exercise, it
00:13:54.079 can be good to work with friends, family, colleagues, other artists, or AI to come up with different ideas. There's
00:14:00.800 no limit to how many you can come up with. And you'll start each one with we believe or we do not believe. So, here's
00:14:07.839 a few examples of how those beliefs might read. And as a note, these don't tie into the same brand's belief system.
00:14:13.839 These are all random. It's just meant to give you a sense of how they can be written. We believe different is better.
00:14:19.600 We're comfortable with being different. We believe in being ourselves. We don't try to be anything we're not. We believe
00:14:25.680 variety is beautiful. We believe there is power in diversity. We believe that it's time for a change. It's time to
00:14:32.399 take down the old guard. We believe art can save the world. So then flipping the other way, we do not believe in
00:14:38.639 following trends. We do not believe we need to fit in. We do not believe bigger is better. We do not believe in bending
00:14:46.000 to the will of others. We do not believe in quantity over quality. We do not
00:14:51.360 believe in genres or boxes when it comes to art. So write as many ideas as you can think of. It's all part of the
00:14:57.920 process. Let it flow and think of it more like community beliefs and less like you the person. What do you want
00:15:04.399 this community to stand for? And what kind of likeminded ideals could bring people into the community? And as a note
00:15:11.120 here, some artists will want to be extreme with these beliefs, and that can be good, but don't feel like you need to
00:15:17.680 be. Just be true to what you want to build. For example, the band Rage Against the Machine, their political
00:15:23.120 views are a big part of their brand and their brand's belief system, and that works for them and their community.
00:15:28.880 While Michael Jordan and the Jordan brand have said from the beginning that their brand, they don't want to get
00:15:34.320 involved in politics. That's not what the brand's about. It's all about greatness and style, not politics. So,
00:15:40.959 there's no right or wrong answer. It's just what's right for you. Step five, edit down and form the system. So, for
00:15:47.760 this section, you're editing. You're looking at your list and you're trying to find the ones that hit hardest and the ones that are most aligned to what
00:15:54.480 you're trying to build. When you look at the full lineup of your beliefs, which for us and the clients that we work with at Colt, generally I like to get six to
00:16:00.720 12 beliefs for the full system. And when you look at the full lineup, you're asking yourself these questions. Does
00:16:06.000 this feel like a complete well-rounded set of beliefs? Do these beliefs feel emotional? Would they tug on the
00:16:11.839 heartstrings of other people? Are there any redundancies? You're saying the same thing twice, but in different ways? Does
00:16:17.680 it feel unique to you and your brand? Can you go out in the world and own these beliefs as its community leader?
00:16:24.000 So, once you've done this edit, there's two more steps which are crucial to completing the system, and I'll explain
00:16:29.120 those in a later section, but here they are. Step six will be do the archetype test. And step seven, do the full stress
00:16:35.920 test on the brand belief system as a whole. So now that you have an understanding of the belief system psychology, you've ideiated on some of
00:16:42.800 your own, you have a good sense of what those might be, I thought it might be valuable to look at some examples from
00:16:47.920 other artists and other brands. And this could bring even more clarity to how you're building out your own system and
00:16:53.920 developing those beliefs. And as a quick note before we get into these examples, something I've seen over the last decade
00:16:59.600 working with Colt is how powerful these brand belief systems can be. For me, in my point of view, I believe that the
00:17:06.000 brand belief system is more important than the actual product. Whatever it is that you're creating, whether that's
00:17:11.919 music, shows, coffee, or clothes, your belief makes up the brand, and it's the
00:17:17.439 flag. When you plant that flag in the sand, it fully represents what the brand stands for and what it's all about. The
00:17:23.520 belief system gives the brand meaning. This meaning will draw people in, and this meaning can create an army. And
00:17:30.400 that army will not only follow the flag, they'll carry it. So you'll see in the coming examples why it might feel this
00:17:36.720 way that when the brand's belief system is clear, you're attaching product to that belief system. And when people buy
00:17:43.679 product or they engage with music, they become part of the brand and they feel that sense of primal human belonging.
00:17:50.160 Section four, examples. So for this section, what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at a bunch of different fashion brands and music artists as
00:17:51.000 No text
00:17:56.240 these are some of the best examples of where beliefs and story can be attached to different offerings. I'll define what
00:18:01.600 I believe their archetype is and then I'll give examples of their brand beliefs. Some of these are actual brand beliefs that the companies or artists
00:18:07.760 have had as forward- facing elements and then some of them are just my educated guess. For each brand, I'll first define
00:18:13.600 the belief concept and then I'll give the belief itself with a brief explanation. All right, so let's get into it. Carheart everyman brand
00:18:20.640 personality archetype concept work ethic as identity belief. We believe work
00:18:26.640 isn't just a job it's a way of life. Carheart's core belief is that hard work defines character. The brand isn't about
00:18:33.120 status or luxury. It's about getting the job done. Their gear is built for bluecollar workers, farmers, builders,
00:18:39.840 mechanics, and people whose livelihood depends on the durability and function of their clothes. Concept durability
00:18:47.120 over trend. belief. We believe when we create things, those things should be built to
00:18:53.120 last. Carheart believes in longevity, clothes that last through harsh conditions, years of wear, and countless
00:18:59.760 repairs. They reject fast fashion and disposable culture. Their products are a promise that quality and resilience
00:19:06.400 matter more than passing trends. Concept: Quality over efficiency.
00:19:12.080 Belief. We do not believe in shortcuts. We are dedicated to taking the time and preparation and put quality above all
00:19:19.120 else. The Carheart brand is rooted in craft and quality. This mirrors the culture of the working class that it's
00:19:25.039 made for. A focus on craft and a dedication to quality work regardless of how long it takes. Concept community and
00:19:32.240 brotherhood and sisterhood. Belief. We believe we can rise together through shared effort and shared struggle.
00:19:39.039 Carheart's brand mythology celebrates a tribe of workers. Wearing Carheart signals that you're part of a
00:19:44.160 brotherhood and sisterhood. This is a tribe of people who value grit, reliability, and self-reliance. It's a
00:19:51.120 uniform of belonging for those who work with their hands. Concept. Utility is beauty. Belief. We believe true style
00:19:59.039 comes from usefulness. Where luxury brands glorify aesthetics, Carheart finds beauty and function. Reinforced
00:20:05.200 seams, triple stitching, deep pockets, form follows function. Their design philosophy is that utility itself is a
00:20:12.000 kind of style and that's a reflection of what one cares about. Concept respect for heritage belief. We believe in
00:20:19.360 representing our history and where we come from. We don't forget where we clocked in. Carheart fiercely believes
00:20:25.760 in its history. It was founded in 1889 in Detroit and still reflects a Midwestern bluecollar value system.
00:20:32.080 Their heritage is not just nostalgia but proof of a long story of showing up,
00:20:37.440 providing and being consistent. Concept evolution without losing roots. Belief.
00:20:43.760 We believe in evolution and adaptation, but we never leave behind our core. Although Carheart's been embraced by
00:20:50.000 many cultures like luxury fashion, street wear, and skate, the brand never abandoned its workerbased DNA. It adapts
00:20:56.960 to new audiences while holding firm in its foundation of what it represents. Next, we're going to look at Amime
00:21:02.000 Leondor creator brand personality archetype concept. Everyday luxury
00:21:07.600 belief. We believe the everyday also deserves refinement. Unlike luxury that's reserved for specific occasions,
00:21:14.799 ALD believes in elevating the everyday. Sweatshirts, sneakers, hoodies, and varsity jackets. Their idea of luxury
00:21:21.280 isn't about being untouchable. It's about making even the most casual piece feel intentional, considered, and
00:21:27.039 timeless. concept nostalgia as identity belief. We believe in our history. The
00:21:33.360 1990s and Queens raised us alongside our Greek heritage. Greece and Queen Streets
00:21:38.559 are where we mine our creative ideas. ALD believes in the emotional power of memory. Their storytelling leans into
00:21:40.000 No text
00:21:44.400 1990s New York City, vintage sportsware, old school hiphop, classic cars, and
00:21:50.080 Mediterranean roots. Nostalgia isn't a gimmick. It's their point of view and how they connect. Concept refinement
00:21:57.039 without pretention belief. We believe elevated doesn't mean exclusive. With
00:22:03.120 ALD, they fuse street clothing with luxury tailoring, but they don't position themselves as elitist. ALD is
00:22:10.000 aspirational, but it feels approachable. Leather loafers sit beside hoop jerseys and sneakers sit beside cashmere coats.
00:22:16.640 Concept. Storytelling is style. Belief. Every piece should tell a story. ALD
00:22:22.720 believes clothing isn't just fabric. It's a narrative. Their campaigns feel like films. Their lookbooks feel like
00:22:28.320 scenes from a movie. The story sells the garment as much as the garment sells the story. Concept. Quality over excess.
00:22:36.159 Belief. We believe in making fewer things but making them right. ALD rejects the noise of disposable fast
00:22:42.960 fashion. Each piece is designed with craft, fabric, and detail in its core.
00:22:48.000 It's not about endless drops, but about building a wardrobe over time. An investment in quality and consistency
00:22:53.679 and a valued driven price. Next up, we have Rick Owens. Rebel brand personality archetype concept. Beauty lives within
00:22:55.000 No text
00:23:00.960 darkness. Belief. We believe true beauty is found in what others fear or ignore.
00:23:06.320 Rick believes beauty isn't always polished, colorful, or pretty. There's elegance in the raw, the asymmetrical,
00:23:12.799 the gothic, and the imperfect. Concept: Rebellion through restraint. We believe
00:23:18.320 true rebellion is subtle, not loud. While other brands scream rebellion through logos or noise, Rick channels it
00:23:24.559 through stark design choices, long silhouettes, and stripped back color palettes. His work and his brand
00:23:30.799 position is a rejection of the status quo. Concept clothing as architecture.
00:23:36.640 Belief. We believe design should create a feeling. It's more than just function. Rick treats fashion like brutalist
00:23:43.520 architecture. His designs are imposing, sculptural, experimental, and uncompromising. He believes clothes
00:23:50.320 should shape how you feel and move through the world, not just be something that you're wearing. Concept.
00:23:56.080 Vulnerability as power. Belief. We believe exposing our human fragility and
00:24:01.280 vulnerability makes us powerful. Rick often shows raw skin, elongated proportions, or exaggerated silhouettes
00:24:08.159 that make the wearer look monumental, exposed, alien, or even weird. Concept:
00:24:13.919 Monochromatic purity. Belief. We believe color distracts from form. Rick largely
00:24:19.279 works in black and white and muted tones. His belief is that stripping away color allows the silhouette, cut, and
00:24:25.200 texture to carry the message with purity. His attention to form is a focus in his work, and this allows the viewer
00:24:31.200 to focus more on the form and less on loud logos and color mixes. Concept. The
00:24:37.039 outsider is the hero. Belief. We believe the ones outside the gates are the ones
00:24:42.640 who can potentially change the world. From his own journey as an outcast in fashion to a cult audience of followers,
00:24:48.720 Rick elevates the outsider and the rebel. His community is built around those who never fit in but who seek
00:24:51.000 No text
00:24:54.720 freedom in all forms. For the next brand, we have one of our clients, Otmar SPK, which is a ruler brand personality
00:25:00.799 archetype. Concept craftsmanship is sacred belief. We believe true value is
00:25:06.159 created by the human hand, not a machine. AP believes in mastery passed down through generations. Every time
00:25:12.640 piece represents skill, patience, and precision. AP by its own admission is the opposite of mass production.
00:25:18.799 Concept. Tradition fuels innovation. Belief. We believe in honoring tradition
00:25:24.799 but never being bound by it. While deeply rooted in Swiss heritage, AP thrives on breaking boundaries. Their
00:25:30.960 belief is that innovation should come from respecting tradition, not from abandoning it. They try new paths and
00:25:36.640 new techniques, but they never leave behind their original traditions. Concept exclusivity creates meaning.
00:25:43.600 Belief. We believe not everything should be for everyone. AP produces a limited
00:25:48.880 number of watches each year, ensuring scarcity and prestige. They believe rarity increases cultural and emotional
00:25:55.039 weight. The scarcity is part of the story, the relationship and the meaning an owner has with one of their pieces.
00:26:01.279 Concept rules of rule breaking. Belief. We believe to break the rules, you must
00:26:07.120 first master them. AP embraces bold risk-taking that redefineses categories. The Royal Oak and its launch was a
00:26:13.520 pinnacle moment in the brand's history and its point of view. Rewriting the rules of what watch pricing looked like.
00:26:19.200 It was a steel watch priced like gold. It was priced that way because of the innovation and mastery behind the steel,
00:26:25.600 not the brass tax price. A confidence in their mastery allowed them to break the rules set by the status quo. Concept
00:26:32.480 community of connoisseurs. Belief. We believe the few who understand create the culture for many. AP doesn't chase
00:26:39.440 mass approval. It cultivates a tight-knit global community of collectors, creatives, and cultural
00:26:44.799 figures who understand and share the brand's values. Concept. Boldness as
00:26:49.919 elegance. Belief. We believe elegance doesn't whisper. It's spoken proudly by
00:26:55.200 the bold. Where many luxury houses hide an understatement, AP believes bold proportion, visible screws, and sharp
00:27:01.840 edges can be elegant. They take a bold approach to their designs, collaboration, and marketing. They
00:27:06.960 believe true taste doesn't need to play small. Okay, so those were brand belief examples for clothing brands. Now, let's
00:27:09.000 No text
00:27:12.880 look at some music brands. Justice rebel in creator brand personality archetypes. Concept. Dance music can have teeth,
00:27:19.919 too. Belief. We believe electronic music can hit just as hard as a live band.
00:27:24.960 Justice believes electronic music doesn't have to be polished or sterile. Their rock and punk infused soul can
00:27:30.320 live just as comfortably with an electronic disco and club style music. Concept rebellion is freedom. Belief. We
00:27:38.400 believe shows can feel like revolutionary moments. Their aesthetic even from the beginning of Marshall Stacks, cigarettes, and leather jackets
00:27:45.200 gave Justice a rebellious punk feel. Their brand rejected the clean, safe side of EDM. Each Justice show was
00:27:51.440 viewed as an opportunity for timeless moments of revolution. The energy at one of their shows could feel more like an
00:27:56.799 arena rock show versus a typical club night or dance act. Concept iconography
00:28:02.320 creates connection. Belief. We believe a defined visual language and strong set
00:28:07.520 of symbols can speak just as loudly as the music. Just as started as graphic designers, so they know the power of
00:28:13.440 symbols and a cohesive visual language. The cross symbol is one of the most recognizable logos in music. Justice
00:28:19.440 believes that symbols, design, and visuals are just as important as the sound in creating culture and building
00:28:24.720 their audience. Concept raw meets polish belief. We believe in keeping it real
00:28:30.640 and raw. Even as they headline festivals, Justice carries the spirit of bedroom producers and punks. In recent
00:28:36.159 years, they've swapped the leather for suits, but they continue to mine ideas from the past, and they believe in keeping things gritty, distorted,
00:28:43.200 hands-on, and imperfect. Their work is always presented with a level of thoughtfulness and polish and they
00:28:48.399 always find a way to make it their own. Concept mystique overexposure. Belief.
00:28:53.919 We believe mystery can often make a voice louder. Unlike DJs who flood social media with content, justice
00:28:59.919 remain reserved and mysterious. They still believe in the mystique of the rockstar, letting the art and visuals
00:29:05.520 speak louder than a constant social media presence. Next up, we have Rufus to Soul. Explorer meets caregiver brand
00:29:08.000 No text
00:29:12.000 personality archetype. Concept music is medicine. Belief. We believe sound can
00:29:18.080 heal the human spirit. Rufus believes their songs can be more than entertainment. They are emotional healing tools. Their music creates
00:29:25.120 catharsis, release, and solace for the people navigating life's highs and lows. When listening to Rufus music, the hope
00:29:31.520 is that it can be the soundtrack for feeling healed. Concept. Togetherness is sacred. Belief. We believe that when we
00:29:39.039 gather, we can become one. The Rufus shows can feel almost like sacred moments. Tens of thousands of people
00:29:45.360 united, singing together under open air. Rufus believes in creating moments of unity and dissolving boundaries between
00:29:52.000 strangers through the shared experience of art and music. The attention to presentation of how their shows are presented is a huge part of their
00:29:58.559 brand's beliefs. Concept: Nature is a stage. Belief, the natural world is the
00:30:04.159 greatest venue. Rufus' music videos and live settings often use deserts, oceans, and vast landscapes. They believe nature
00:30:11.120 amplifies music spiritual power. There's a deeper human connection when it comes to nature and Rufus is keen to present
00:30:17.360 that concept. Light in darkness belief. We believe hope lives even in shadows.
00:30:23.440 Unlike EDM's typical high energy packaging, Rufus leans into the bittersweet and the real light in the
00:30:29.760 darkness. Their lyrics and visuals can often touch on despair, but they always end with light breaking through the
00:30:35.039 darkness. They believe the contrast between light and darkness is what makes hope meaningful. Concept. Authenticity
00:30:41.919 over trend. Belief. We believe in staying true to oneself over following and adhering to trends. Even though they
00:30:48.880 have a massive audience, Rufus avoids chasing trends. Their sonic identity is authentically them. And within a few
00:30:55.039 bars of a song, you can almost instantly tell that it's Rufus. For the next music brand, we have John Summit, who
00:30:57.000 No text
00:31:00.399 historically has been an everyman brand personality archetype, but is currently transitioning to a hero brand
00:31:05.760 personality archetype. So, as we run the belief system, I'm going to do it from the point of view of the everyman brand
00:31:11.120 concept. The party is the point belief. We believe life is a celebration of
00:31:16.799 friendship and togetherness. John Summit believes music isn't just for listening, it's for living. It's the soundtrack for
00:31:23.200 life's bonding moments. His brand is about night life, the after hours parties, and turning every set into a
00:31:29.200 communal moment amongst his friends. Concept. Honesty is relatability.
00:31:34.320 Belief. We believe being yourself is better than being perfect. Summit is fully himself and real in how the brand
00:31:39.919 is presented. He shares his crazy world, his humor, his hangovers, and his flaws all with his fans. He believes being
00:31:46.080 real is more powerful than being polished. The only way to truly connect is to be yourself. Concept. Fans are
00:31:52.640 friends, not followers. Belief. We do not believe in fans. We believe in
00:31:57.919 friends. Summit's online persona feels like you're hanging out with him at an afterparty. He doesn't believe in the
00:32:03.600 hierarchy of artist to fan. He believes we're all on the same level and we can all be friends. Concept. Find the
00:32:09.600 energy. Belief. We believe energy can connect us on the highest level. Where
00:32:14.880 some DJs obsess over flawless technicality, Summit embraces raw energy and moments. The moments themselves
00:32:21.519 matter more than the perfection around the technical ability. Find the energy. Find the connection. Concept. Real
00:32:28.000 humor. Belief. We believe humor can connect us just as much as a good track.
00:32:33.200 From memes to self-deprecating posts, Summit believes humor builds connection and disarms ego. The relatability part
00:32:39.519 of his brand is presenting himself the same way he would with his close friends. The sense of humor and comfort
00:32:44.559 you have amongst your friends can be one of the most bonding elements of that friendship. Summit uses this to build
00:32:50.240 his community. Concept. Music is a lifestyle, not a job. Belief. We believe
00:32:56.240 that to embody the music, you must live it. Summit isn't just performing. He's living the same party life as his fans.
00:33:02.480 He believes DJing is an extension of who he is. It's a way to build a community, and it's a way to connect. Next, for
00:33:08.000 No text
00:33:08.559 music brands, we have Billy Isish, who is a creator and rebel brand personality archetype. Concept. Vulnerability is
00:33:15.519 strength. Belief. We believe embracing your scars makes you stronger. Billy believes in exposing raw emotions,
00:33:22.000 depression, anxiety, longing, angst, and not hiding them. She treats openness as power, not as a weakness. Concept
00:33:29.600 expression comes from the internal, not the external. Belief. We believe the
00:33:34.640 goal is to be truthful and authentic, even if society says otherwise. Billy rejects industry stereotypes of how a
00:33:40.960 pop star should look or act. Billy built her brand by refusing polish and embracing what she thought was cool. She
00:33:46.880 subverted expectations with horror inspired visuals in a pop landscape and whispery vocals. Allah James Blunt
00:33:53.600 instead of belted held notes. Concept family and creative integrity first.
00:33:59.039 Belief stay true to the people and process that made you from the beginning. Her music has been crafted
00:34:04.159 with her brother Phineas. She believes artistry comes from intimate trusted collaborations. She's particular in who
00:34:10.159 she keeps in her creative circle and whose opinion she listens to. Her relationship with Phineas not only affects what's being made, but affects
00:34:17.040 how it's being made. Concept: Youth has a voice. Belief: Age doesn't limit
00:34:22.320 impact. Billy represents the new generation in a way that's different than other artists. She's unapologetic
00:34:27.520 in addressing topics like mental health, climate change, and body image. She believes young people's voices matter in
00:34:33.280 shaping culture. Her honesty, her experience, and her point of view is her voice. And that voice is a reflection of
00:34:39.440 her true emotions. Because through the honesty of presenting what she cares about, Billy has become one of the
00:34:44.639 strongest voices of her generation. Concept. Shadows can be alluring. Belief. We believe that there's beauty
00:34:51.440 in dark things. Much like Rick Owens, some of Billy's early brand aesthetic embraced goth, horror, and melancholic
00:34:57.520 visuals, turning darkness into something stylish. The dark side of her work in a pop world was unique, relatable, and
00:35:03.839 even comforting. Concept. Bottle the bedroom and take it to the stage. Belief. We believe the biggest stage can
00:35:11.119 still feel like a bedroom. Even in arenas, Billy shows feel personal and intimate. She sings quietly into the mic
00:35:17.920 and has intimate moments with her fans. She believes global stardom doesn't need to lose intimacy. So, I know this was a
00:35:22.000 No text
00:35:23.839 lot, but these were some examples of brand belief systems and how this exercise is meant to bring clarity to
00:35:29.200 the foundational elements that the brand stands for. So, now combining this knowledge with some of the beliefs that you've already written, there's only a
00:35:35.440 few steps left to ensure that your brand belief system is strong and it will hold up over time. Section five, archetype
00:35:41.440 check. So, now you've got your beliefs and we reviewed some examples of other brands and their potential beliefs. So
00:35:47.280 now an important part of the process is to run your beliefs through your archetype and make sure those two things
00:35:52.880 line up. You're asking yourself, do these beliefs sound like they're coming from the personality archetype voice of
00:35:58.240 my brand? For example, let's say I was working with an artist and they were a rebel brand personality archetype and they presented me a set of beliefs. I'd
00:36:05.119 be looking to see if those beliefs centered around freedom and creating your own path. Or as another example,
00:36:10.240 let's say I was working with a creator brand archetype and they presented me their beliefs. I'd be looking to see if those were focused on creation,
00:36:17.040 imagination, and an devotion to making things and sharing things. So, you're making sure that the belief system lines
00:36:23.280 up with the motivation of the archetype. And this is essential to making the full brand feel cohesive. So, now that you've
00:36:29.520 run it through the main filter, that is the archetype test. Let's do a full stress test to make sure that all the
00:36:35.280 other elements line up as well. So, after running the beliefs through your brand archetype, and now those both line
00:36:40.480 up and feel good, it's time to see if each belief makes it through a final stress test. So, test number one is the
00:36:47.119 hater test. Does your belief system create a clear enemy or someone who would be absolutely opposed to the set
00:36:53.599 of beliefs? Remember, in order to have super fans, you're also going to have super haters. Test two, the unique test.
00:37:01.200 When you're looking at your lineup of beliefs, you're asking, "Do a few of these beliefs set the brand apart from
00:37:06.560 other brands?" Often what can happen during the build phase of the brand belief system is ideas are selected and
00:37:12.640 they're absolutely true to the brand, but if you were to apply them to other brands, they would work just as well.
00:37:18.079 For example, say you had we believe in being authentic. Now, while that's a great belief to own, couldn't that
00:37:23.280 statement or belief be applied to almost any brand in the world? Every brand is trying to show up authentically. So,
00:37:28.960 while it's true, it may be too generic and not unique enough to set the brand apart. When thinking about building your
00:37:34.960 belief system, you should have a similar filter of finding and describing a few beliefs that are solely for your brand,
00:37:41.359 and it would be hard to apply it to another brand. Test three, the time test. So, if trends change, can you
00:37:47.200 still stand by these beliefs in 5 years? That's how you know a belief has legs and is pure. It's not just based on time
00:37:54.240 or trends. Justice, who we talked about earlier, has been around for almost 20 years. And one of the brand beliefs we
00:37:59.599 had for them was electronic music should hit as hard as a live band now. When running this belief through the time test, would this same belief hold up
00:38:06.560 over the next 5 years, 10 years, 15 years? Yes, it would because they had the same belief 20 years ago and it
00:38:13.119 still remains true to them today. So, as an example, this particular belief passes the time test. Test four, the
00:38:18.880 flip test. So, now take the belief and reverse it. So, with the reversed version, if we were to claim that
00:38:24.640 version, would someone still possibly choose us for it? If they would, maybe the belief is too generic or it's not
00:38:30.400 strong enough. Test five, t-shirt test. So, if you were to take a belief and put it on a t-shirt, does it feel more like
00:38:37.200 a slogan or like a true belief that you could live by. You want it feeling like a belief you live by and ideally a
00:38:43.520 belief someone could identify with and own. For example, we had the belief with Amime Leondur that we believe in our
00:38:49.680 history. The 1990s in Queens raised us alongside our Greek heritage. Maybe it wouldn't make for the best t-shirt
00:38:55.920 graphic, but it's absolutely ownable. Test six, the pledge. So, I'm going to date myself here, but I grew up in a
00:39:02.079 time where we said the pledge of allegiance to the American flag every morning in school. It was a unique part
00:39:07.440 of our American culture. For better or worse, its purpose was to try and bond us to our country, its beliefs, and its
00:39:13.920 ideals. But as an example for your brand, if someone were to read the beliefs, could they use it as their own
00:39:19.280 as a pledge to embody the spirit of what the idea of the brand was all about? Does this pledge hit emotional chords?
00:39:25.280 Is it more about humanity and the human experience than it is a product or music? If so, you're in a great place
00:39:31.280 because you're now tapping into primal human needs. So, doing the stress test is the final step in building out the
00:39:37.040 brand's belief system. But now, you may be asking, how will these brand beliefs affect the other parts of my brand?
00:39:42.960 Section seven. bringing it all together. So, your brand beliefs will be a foundational element for your brand and
00:39:48.960 its story. It will play into every aspect of your brand. It's essential in building a strong brand identity. And
00:39:55.359 when you have a strong brand identity and it's clear, the fans of the brand use your identity as their own. The
00:40:02.079 brand beliefs will help define what your movie is all about. your archetype, your visual identity, how things are
00:40:08.400 packaged, the video content, the photo content, the colors, it all plays into the brand's beliefs, the brand's
00:40:14.800 personality, and the brand's voice. Defining your brand belief system will help define how the brand shows up at
00:40:20.640 every touch point, trying to convert new members into the community. And as a note, we have individual videos on
00:40:26.880 almost all these topics on the neighborhood art supply channel if you're interested in watching those and going deeper with your brand. But I hope
00:40:32.720 this helps. And if you need more help defining your brand beliefs, your brand's story, or your brand's visual identity, you know where we are. All
00:40:39.040 things the Colt Creatives, the colcreatives.com. But until next time, good luck building your cult, and I'll
00:40:44.480 see you on the next one. Peace.
